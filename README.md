# Prop Swap

Prop Swap is a place for off-West End theatres to list and lend props they have in storage. Theatres can create a profile, list their items and add them to categories. Other users can then browse or search for the props they need and contact the owner to borrow, avoiding expensive hire fees.

Prop Swap is a full-stack app with a Ruby on Rails API, an SQL database and a front end built with AngularJS.
